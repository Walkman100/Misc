To 'install' this script, just copy the "sudo.cmd" file to your "C:/Windows" folder (requires admin rights)
This script allows you to execute commands as administrator (it does ask for your password though, so not a security hack) in Windows command prompt (CMD) for example, without opening the command prompt as admin. try opening command prompt (Win key + R, type "cmd", enter) and executing "sudo taskmgr". It also allows making shortcuts that run as admin, for example you can make a shortcut on your desktop that links to "sudo taskmgr" and runs Task Manager as admin when you open it.
