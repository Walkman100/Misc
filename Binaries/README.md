# sudo.cmd
- To 'install' this script, just copy the `sudo.cmd` file to your `C:/Windows` folder (requires admin rights)
- This script allows you to execute commands as administrator (it does ask for your password though, so not a security hack) in Windows command prompt (CMD) for example, without opening the command prompt as admin
- After install, try opening command prompt (<kbd>âŠž Win</kbd> & <kbd>R</kbd>, type `cmd`, <kbd>enter</kbd>) and executing `sudo taskmgr`
- It also allows making shortcuts that run as admin, for example you can make a shortcut on your desktop that links to `sudo taskmgr` and runs Task Manager as admin when you open it.
